## Description
This app logs the burgers that you devour! This app's primary purpose was to experiment with MYSQL and express in order to deploy a live site with a database connection to heroku. The site itself is very simple, but the deployment to heroku with a database was quite envolved.

## Technologies used
I used MYSQL along with the heroku addon JAWSDB to get the sql database to function with the heroku deployed app. Additionally, I used node.js, express, handlebars, and html/css to construct the server and the page.
